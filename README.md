📌 Problem Statement

Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique used to identify sentiment from text.
This project analyzes user reviews of a ChatGPT app and classifies them into:
Positive,
Neutral,
Negative.

🎯 Goals

1.Gain insights into user satisfaction;

2.Identify common issues;

3.Improve app features and user experience.

💼 Business Use Cases

1.Customer Feedback Analysis – Improve product features

2.Brand Reputation Management – Track sentiment over time

3.Feature Enhancement – Spot issues in negative/neutral reviews

4.Automated Support – Prioritize issues based on sentiment

5.Marketing Optimization – Design campaigns based on sentiment insights

🧹 Data Preprocessing

1.Removing special characters, punctuation, stopwords;

2.Tokenization & Lemmatization;

3.Lowercasing text;

4.Handling missing values;

5.Language detection (if needed).

🔍 Project Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
>Clean and normalize text data

>Handle missing values

>Balance the dataset

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
>Analyze sentiment distribution

>WordClouds and frequency plots

3. Modeling
   
>Feature extraction: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, BERT

>Models used:
Naïve Bayes;
Logistic Regression;
Random Forest;
LSTM;
Transformer-based models.

5. Model Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC Curve

6. Deployment
>Interactive web app using Streamlit

>Predict sentiment of new user reviews
